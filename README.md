# Windows-Google-Lens
Google lens for windows is not an application or software, it combines the powers of AHK and Python to take a screenshot, and use it with Google Lens

Use the hotkey: "Windows + ctrl + S" to use Windows Google Lens

# Requirments
* Windows
* Chrome
* Python (Not needed if you want to download the .exe version of LocationFinder{Reccommended})
* AutoHotKey (Not needed if you want to download the .exe version of LensForWindows{Recommended})

# Download guide
Just download both "LensForWindows", and "LocationFinder" and drop them in the same directory

# Notes
* Ensure that you dont touch the keyboard or mouse so that you don't distrupt the keystrokes being sent
* While taking a screenshot you have 5 seconds to complete it, or it will not work properly
* Create a shortcut of LensForWindows and place it in the Startup directory (Access by Windows + R, then typing "shell:startup"), this will automatically run the file on system startup
* It is recommended to install the .exe version of LensForWindows so that AHK is not needed
* It is recommended to install the .py version of LocationFinder as sometime Microsoft Antivirus thinks that the .exe version is a trojan virus
* It is recommended to disable notifications from Snipping Tool, or reducing the amount of time for a notification pop-up for a smooth run
