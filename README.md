# Notes
* Ensure that you dont touch the keyboard or mouse so that you don't distrupt the keystrokes being sent
* While taking a screenshot you have 5 seconds to complete it, or it will not work properly
* Create a basic task with time schedular for "When the user logs in" for "LensForWindows(HotKey).exe" file so that it automatically starts up without you needing to click it on system startup
